# Ebon's Unfixer Mod
If you're like me and you have been playing Wrath of the Righteous for a couple years off-and-on and each time you return to the game you find out Owlcat "fixed" a feature that you built around and now your characters are markedly worse, this mod is for you. The intent of this mod is merely to revert/unfix some of the fixes that Owlcat implemented since launch which haven't been reverted elsewhere. This requires [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core "TabletopTweaks-Core").

## The Unfixes
* **Critical Threat Range Calculation:** the way threat range is calculated is restored to the glorious time before the recent patch that "fixed" it. Gravesinger? Great again. Trickster critical feats? Great again.
* **Bane Of Spirit:** remember when the Bane of Spirit ring allowed you to change any ally's damage into force damage with a free action? Do you hate that it got made into a swift action ability? Well now it is a free action again! Not a full revert to when it made *everything* into force damage (infinite force damage cave fangs anyone?), but a big step in that direction.
* **Shatter Defenses:** the intimidation melee ability *par excellence* before it got "fixed" and actually required you to hit the target before making them flat-footed. Now it checks for shaken/frightened before the attack roll again. Beautiful.

## Installation
1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager).
